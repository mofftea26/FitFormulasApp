  "Prioritize protein: aim ~1.6–2.2 g/kg body weight daily.",
  "Sleep 7–9 hours — recovery builds muscle, not just workouts.",
  "Track your lifts; progressive overload beats random training.",
  "Hydrate: ~30–40 ml/kg daily, more in hot weather or hard sessions.",
  "Micronutrients matter: fruits, veggies, and iodized salt for thyroid health.",
  "Warm up joints and pattern the movement before loading heavy.",
  "Keep 70–80% of sets in 0–3 RIR; sprinkle heavier work strategically.",
  "Carbs around training improve performance and recovery.",
  "Creatine monohydrate 3–5 g daily — consistent, not cyclical.",
  "NEAT (daily steps) drives fat loss more than you think — aim 7–10k.",
  "Use tempos and full ROM to own the rep, not just move weight.",
  "Deload or pivot every 6–10 weeks to keep progress moving.",
  "Don’t chase soreness; chase performance and good technique.",
  "Log biofeedback: sleep, energy, hunger, stress — adjust accordingly.",
